## Getting and Cleaning Data Project



### Information
Each of the records in the dataset: 
- Acceleration from the accelerometer. 
- Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- Time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 


### 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt



## 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 


## 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set


## 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.


## 5. Create independent tidy data set
